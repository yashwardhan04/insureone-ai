What is health insurance?,"Health insurance is a contract between you and an insurance company where you pay a premium in exchange for coverage of certain medical expenses, such as hospitalization, doctor visits, and surgeries."
Why is health insurance important?,"Health insurance is important because it protects you from high medical costs by covering or reimbursing eligible healthcare expenses, ensuring you can access care without financial hardship."
How does health insurance work?,"When you buy health insurance, you pay a regular premium. In return, your insurer pays for eligible medical expenses up to the policy limits when you need care."
What types of health insurance plans are there?,"Common types of health insurance plans include Individual plans, Family Floater plans, Senior Citizen plans, Critical Illness plans, and Group insurance plans through employers."
What is the difference between individual and family floater plans?,"An Individual plan covers one person only, whereas a Family Floater plan covers the entire family under a single sum insured, which is shared among all insured members."
How does your AI tool estimate the right coverage amount?,"Our AI tool collects your age, gender, lifestyle habits, medical history, and other relevant information to calculate a personalized coverage amount that aligns with your health risk profile."
Is the AI estimate accurate or final?,"The AI estimate is a smart recommendation based on your inputs; however, the final approval and premium may vary after underwriting and medical evaluations."
What information do I need to provide for the estimate?,"You need to provide basic details like age, gender, height, weight, lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking, alcohol), existing medical conditions, and family medical history for a precise estimate."
Can I update my details after getting an estimate?,"Yes, you can update your details at any time. Simply re-enter your information, and the AI will generate a new estimate based on the updated data."
Is my data safe with this tool?,"Absolutely. We follow industry-standard security protocols and never share your personal data. Your information is used solely to calculate your insurance estimate."

What is a deductible?,"A deductible is the amount you must pay out-of-pocket for healthcare services before your insurer starts covering expenses."

How often do I need to pay premiums?,"Premiums are usually paid on a frequency of your choice—monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually—depending on your policy terms."
